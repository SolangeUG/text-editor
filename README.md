##### Week 2 : Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking

- `document.EfficientDocument.java`

##### Week 3 : Interfaces, Linked Lists vs. Arrays, and Correctness

- `textgen.MyLinkedList*.java`
- `textgen.MarkovTextGenerator.java`
- `textgen.MarkovTextGenerator*.java`

##### Week 4 : Trees! (including Binary Search Trees and Tries)

- `spelling.SpellingSuggest.java`
- `spelling.AutoComplete.java`
- `spelling.Dictionary.java`
- `spelling.Dictionary*.java`
- `spelling.AutoCompleteDictionaryTrie.java`
- `spelling.TrieNode.java`

##### Week 5 : Hash Maps and Edit Distance

#### <u>Setup</u> 

Importing Project into eclipse:
- Create a new Java Project in your workspace
- Import the starter files:
	  `File` → `Import` → `Select "File System"` → `Next` → Browse and set 
	  root directory to folder contents of zip were extracted to → `Finish`

Feel free to use another IDE or manually compile and run your programs.
If you need help, google is your friend.

#### <u>Acknowledgment</u>

A big thank you to Tomas Mikula for creating [RichTextFX](https://github.com/TomasMikula/RichTextFX) which was used as the text area in the GUI application.
